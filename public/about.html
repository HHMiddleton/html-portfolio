<h1>About Me</h1>
<p></p>

<p>My name is Heather Hausenfleck-Middleton. I have over five years experience working as administrative support, 
  first in an academic office at Kennesaw State University, then as a Tax Preparer and an Office Manager at 
  Sprint Tax & Insurance and was one of the only employees chosen to remain on after the tax season ended. Most recently,
   I have been at Heartland Payroll, a part of Global Payments, where I've worked as Administrative Assistant and Office Manager. 
   These roles have often called on my to use my skills with Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office, and Google Suite 
   to perform duties beyond Administrative support as necessary. .</p>

<p>I hold a Bachelor's Degree from Kennesaw State University in World History and Cultures and graduated Cum Laude. 
  This experience provided me with excellent research and writing skills. Further education in the Graduate History 
  and Education departments at Georgia State University has expounded on those skills</p>

  <p>I pride myself on my ability to learn quickly. I learned the tax system and software in less than two weeks. 
    I am able to learn and adapt to new software systems and programs very quickly and am often able to help others learn them as well.  
    My education and work experience  have provided  me with excellent written and oral communication skills, as well as problem solving 
    and multitasking skills. </p>
